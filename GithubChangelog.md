<h4 style="text-align: center;">To use /report properly you need to send a /report when the player is cheating, not 2 minutes after, not after the game ended or before the game started. Doing /report leaves a timestamp in the replay for the game masters. I changed the auto-reporting feature accordingly.</h2>

- Enhancements
  - add support for tokens for short coins messages feature
- Hacker Detector
  - increase speed to type auto-reports
  - abort sending auto-report if you wait too long (30 seconds)
  - fix adding auto reports to chat command history properly 
  - fix all Noslowdown fasle flags (I think)
  - fix fastbreak false flag if you have a lag spike
